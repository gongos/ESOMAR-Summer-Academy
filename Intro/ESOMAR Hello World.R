# My first program in R Programming
# We can use the print() function
print("Hello World!")

# Quotes can be suppressed in the output
print("Hello World!", quote = FALSE)

# We can also assign to a variable first
myString <- "Hello, World!"
print (myString)

# If there are more than 1 item, we can concatenate using paste()
print(paste("How", "are", "you?"))
